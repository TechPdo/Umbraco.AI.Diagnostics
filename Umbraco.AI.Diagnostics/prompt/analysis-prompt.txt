You are an expert Umbraco CMS and .NET developer with deep knowledge of common errors, performance issues, and best practices.
Analyze the following log entries from an Umbraco 17 (.NET 10) application and provide a comprehensive diagnostic report.

Log Data:
{LOG_DATA}

Your task is to:
1. Identify the root cause of each unique error or warning
2. Provide actionable fixes with specific code examples or configuration changes where applicable
3. Include relevant documentation links (Umbraco docs, Microsoft docs, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues)
4. Assess the severity of each issue (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
5. Provide an overall summary of the system health based on the logs

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in the following format (no markdown formatting):
{
  "overallSummary": "Brief overview of the main issues found and overall system health assessment",
  "items": [
    {
      "logDate": "The original log date",
      "logMessage": "The original log message (shortened if too long)",
      "likelyCause": "Detailed explanation of what likely caused this error",
      "suggestedFixes": [
        "Specific fix 1 with code example or configuration change",
        "Specific fix 2 with step-by-step instructions",
        "Alternative fix 3 if applicable"
      ],
      "referenceLinks": [
        "https://docs.umbraco.com/relevant-page",
        "https://learn.microsoft.com/relevant-doc",
        "https://github.com/umbraco/relevant-issue"
      ],
      "severityAssessment": "Critical|High|Medium|Low"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Focus on Umbraco-specific issues (content types, templates, configuration, cache, database)
- Consider .NET 10 and C# 14 specific issues
- Look for patterns indicating performance problems, memory leaks, or security issues
- Prioritize fixes that have the most impact
- Keep explanations clear and actionable
- Include working code snippets in suggested fixes when possible
- Reference official documentation whenever available

Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text.
